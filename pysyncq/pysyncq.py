    Creates a synchronisation queue. name is a str that names the shared memory
    that is the backbone of the queue, and to which all processes will connect.
    create is a bool that signals whether to create new shared memory (True) or
    to use existing shared memory (False). size is an int of 0 or greater giving
    the number of bytes to request for the shared memory. start names the start
    method that will be used to create child processes. Hence, this must be a
    valid start method string as returned by the multiprocessing module's
    get_all_start_methods(). If start is None then multiprocessing's 
    get_start_method() is called to determine the start method string.
    
    Each process that wishes to read/write on the queue must make a separate
    call to the .open( ) method, in order to register itself with the queue as
    a unique reader/writer.

        Reads the next next unread message from the queue and returns the tuple
        ( sender , type , msg ) ... see append. If the sender or type string is
        found in the scrnsend or scrntype sets, respectively, then the message
        is skipped, and pop looks for the next unread message in the queue. If
        there are no unread and unscreened messages then None is returned,
        unless block is True.
        
        Then pop will wait until there is a new message to read. Pop will wait
        indefinitely if timer is None. Otherwise, timer can be a float that
        gives the number of seconds that pop will wait for. If the timer expires
        before an unread message becomes available then None will be returned.
        
        By default, messages are decoded from bytes to str with the default
        encoding. But if decode is False then the raw bytes are returned.
